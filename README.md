# UpCloud Frontend App

Hi there! This package contains the UpCloud frontend technology stack and an
unfinished web app.

There are design mockups in the `design-mockups/` directory for the two pages
that this app should show when finished. Please spend about 2-3 hours to explore
the code, get the project running, and possibly write some code! Implement what
you can in the time allotted :) We don't expect you to code the whole app,
gathering some thoughts about the tech stack and how you would approach the
problem is great as well!

The tech stack includes:

- TypeScript
- Next.js
- React.js
- styled-jsx
- Sass/SCSS

(note: UpCloud also uses Redux, but it was omitted here for simplicity)

Let's be in touch and arrange a meeting where we can together go through your
thoughts about everything you saw & did here :) We'd love to know what you
thought about the tech stack and working on this!

Lastly, we'd like to emphasize that 2-3 hours is good, as we don't want to take
up too much of your valuable time at this point!

### Getting Started

Install the required packages with `yarn install` or `npm i`.

Start the dev server with `yarn dev` or `npm run dev`

Open http://localhost:3000 and you should see the app homepage!

If you are having any problems, please do not hesitate to contact us!

### About the Mockups

The `1-servers-page.png` shows a mockup of the "Servers" page. Users can access
this page via the link at the top-right corner. The page shows a server list
with each server's title, state (green = started, red = stopped, yellow = any
other state), and hostname.

At the top-right corner, you can see the "Storages"-link to open the "Storages"
page. The `2-storages-page.png` shows a mockup of the "Storages" page. This is
just a simple list of storages with their title and size.

### Hints & Tips

**Don't want TypeScript?** Use .js files and TypeScript will ignore typings.
You can also rename the existing template files to .js if you feel like it.

**We are more than happy to see you add your own flair!** For example making UX
better, adding loading states, skeleton screens, error states, unit tests,
responsive design, routing, ...

### Returns

Feel free to post this code in GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket or any service of your
choosing. You can also e.g. upload the code as a zip somewhere. Send us the link
to the code in an email when you're done!
